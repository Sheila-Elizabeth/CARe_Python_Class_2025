The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

My name is Sheila Elizabeth du Toit, and I am currently a student interested in expanding my technical skills. My main goal for learning a programming language is to strengthen my problem-solving abilities. I believe that programming is a valuable skill across many fields, and I hope to use it to analyse data, automate tasks, as well as developing efficient solutions in my future career.

The last time I was without a computer was during a weekend camping trip in the mountains of Montagu, South Africa, about three months ago. There was no access to phones, laptops, or any electronic devices, only nature and a few basic essentials.
